# IBMCloud Kubernetes Tutorial
Tutorial how to create a docker image, upload the image on *IBM Container Registry* and deploy it on IBM Kubernetes Services.

## 1. Writing a Hello World app
Lets use a simple hello world web app  `src/server.js`

```javascript
var http = require('http');

var handleRequest = (request,response) => {
  console.log('Received request for URL: ' + request.url);
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end('Hello World!');
};

var server = http.createServer(handleRequest);
server.listen(8080);
```
and `src/Dockerfile` to specify image

```Dockerfile 
FROM node:6.14.2
EXPOSE 8080
COPY server.js .
CMD node server.js
```

## 2. Creating a Docker Image
If you don't have a Docker CLI installed, do it now. https://docs.docker.com/install/

We need to build an image from Dockerfile
```shell
$ cd src/
$ docker build -t helloworld-example .
```
`-t` option names and optionally tag an image in image:tag format. The dot represents a path to Dockerfile.

To test the image locally we can run the image
```shell
$ docker run -p 3000:8080 helloworld-example
```
`-p` option publish a container's port(s) to the host. By default, when you create a container, it does not publish any of its ports to the outside world. Notation `3000:8080` says that we want to redirect container port `8080` to host port `3000:8080` which I randomly chose - should be empty for our usage.

You should see on [127.0.0.1:3000]() the output
```
Hello World!
```

## 3. Uploading the Docker Image on IBM Container Registry
### Install, Setup and Login

If you already installed the IBM CLoud CLI and you also set up your private registry namespace before, you can skip step 1.

1. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install)
2.  Log in to your IBM Cloud account. 
```shell 
$ ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com
```
If you have a federated ID, use command below to log in to the IBM Cloud CLI.
```shell 
$ ibmcloud login --sso
``` 
3. Choose a name for your first namespace, and create that namespace. Let's name it `helloworld-example-ns`
```shell
$ ibmcloud cr namespace-add helloworld-example-ns
```

### Push the image to your private registry
1. Log your local Docker daemon into the IBM Cloud Container Registry
```shell
$ ibmcloud cr login
```

2. Choose an image that we created above and tag it to the Container Registry adress.
```shell
$ docker tag helloworld-example de.icr.io/helloworld-example-ns/helloworld-example
```

3. Push the image to Cloud Container registry.
```shell
$ docker push de.icr.io/helloworld-example-ns/helloworld-example
```

4. You can Check if the image is in private registry
```shell
$ ibmcloud cr image-list
```
you should get something like that
```
REPOSITORY                                          TAG  DIGEST         NAMESPACE               CREATED        SIZE     SECURITY STATUS   
de.icr.io/helloworld-example-ns/helloworld-example  1    110c84897f17   watsonilab-ns-example   17 hours ago   27 MB    No Issues  
```

## 4. Create a Kubernetes cluster in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.
Create a cluster. Let's name it `helloworld-example-cluster`
```shell
$ ibmcloud ks cluster-create --name helloworld-example-cluster
```


Verify that the creation of the cluster was requested. It can take a few minutes for the worker node machine to be ordered.
```shell 
 $ ibmcloud ks clusters
```

Check the status of the worker node.
```shell 
 $  ibmcloud ks workers --cluster helloworld-example-cluster
```
## 5. Deploy a container from your image to the cluster.

Create a service
```shell 
 $ kubectl run example1 --image=de.icr.io/helloworld-example-ns/helloworld-example 
```

Deploy
```shell 
 $  kubectl expose deployment helloworld-example --type=NodePort --port=8383 --name=helloworld-example-service --target-port=8080  
```

check if service is created
```shell 
 $ kubectl get services 
```

you should see something like this
```
NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP  EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
helloworld-example-service  NodePort    172.x.x.x   <none>        8383:32029/TCP   3h15m
kubernetes                  ClusterIP   172.x.x.x   <none>        443/TCP          3h25m
```
Now we know the port from which the service is accessible from out. `8383:32029/TCP` is the same notation as above, so we can access the service on the port `32039`.

Since the External-IP of the service is not available (available only in the Premium version) we need to find out the IP adress of the worker in cluster where the service runs. We run again

```shell 
 $  ibmcloud ks workers --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> 
```
and we get output like this
```
ID  Public IP   Private IP  Machine Type   State    Status   Zone    Version   
x   159.x.x.x   10.x.x.x    free           normal   Ready    mil01   1.13.7_1528 
```

Right know we know everything to connect to the service - the IP is 159.122.187.43 and the port is 32029 so we will try to connect to [159.x.x.x:32029]() and we get 
```
Hello World!
```

and that's it ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. Now you know everything to deploy your own app on Kubernetes.
